      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>How many times have you wanted to cook a delicious meal but haven't because it's "too complicated", or it "takes too much time"? Well, I am going to make a website to solve this problem for your busy college schedule or broke college student life. On my website I will compile various recipes that only use up to 5 ingredients, making them cheap and easy for you to deal with. So forget about your ramen and nasty frozen microwavable meals and come visit my website!</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>For my audience I am mostly focusing on college students because we have very busy lives and sometimes even a tight budget. But realistically this website can be useful to anyone that would like to start learning to cook with quick and simple recipes.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        My website will be focused on compiling various recipes that require 5 ingredients or less. I am doing this as a way of helping people that either don’t have a lot of time, money or even both. My target audience is mostly college students because I think they fall into this category very well. My hope is that this will also help people that don’t know how to cook too well or maybe not know how to cook at all. Maybe you’re feeling lazy and don’t really know what to make for dinner tonight. In that case you could just visit my website and find a quick easy recipe to make using the ingredients you might already have at your disposal. The homepage for the website will probably have some images displaying some of the recipes that the sight has, along with links at the top to any of the other subpages. There could also be images further down the page with the appropriate links to the different sections of food types.
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Dinner Recipes</h3>
      <p>
        I might also have the website divided into different pages for different occasions such as breakfast recipes, dinner recipes, dessert recipes and maybe some snacks or something simpler to eat throughout the day. This particular page will be focusing on the dinner recipes that you could try out.

      </ul>
      <h3>Help in the Kitchen</h3>
      <p>
        Maybe it would also be a feature to have basic cooking terminology listed out and explained for the users of the website. Things that not everyone knows about such as “sauteing”, “deglazing”, or “mince”. Including basic information like this will hopefully educate the user about different cooking techniques and inspire them to try harder recipes later on. Afterall cooking is a learning process, you have to learn the basics to be able to do harder things.
