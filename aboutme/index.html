      <h2>Brandon Wise</h2>
    <p>Hey my name is Brandon and I am currently working on my computer science degree.
      I like to work out or do any activities outside, I also really like music and playing instruments.
      I have been a memeber of the church ever since I was little, and I was actually baptized in Mexico.</p>
    <p>I really like computers and learning new things about them. 
      I think this course is really good for us to learn how websites are made,
      and so we have an idea of how much work goes into one.</p>
